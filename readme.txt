The project is called Paleta Parlor. This game will be a restaurant simulator where the objective is to fulfill orders for paletas. Paletas are a Mexican ice pop or ice cream dessert that can be customized through different flavors, dips, and toppings. Based on each customerâ€™s order, the player will make the paletas and be awarded points for how accurate their orders are. After the player gets a certain amount of points, they will unlock new customization options.

All of the code can be found in one file called "paletasParlor" and can be run on VS Code. The data used throughout the code are the mp3 background music file along with the different imported images used for the toppings. . For example, which file the user should run in an editor.
